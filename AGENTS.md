## Architecture rules
- Feature code lives in `src/features/<feature>/` (components, logic); routes in `src/routes/` stay thin. Why: keeps the future SaaS modules isolated and maintainable.
- Product-wide constants (name, copy) live in `src/config/site.ts`. Why: single source for branding.
- No backend is connected; any future backend must be the owner's independent Supabase, never Lovable Cloud. Why: explicit owner constraint.
